# PathFinder
Overview

This project is a Pathfinder Visualization Tool that demonstrates Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a grid. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

1. Interactive grid layout
2. Select start and end points
3. Visual representation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. Dynamic pathfinding updates
5. Responsive and easy-to-use UI

Usage

1. Click on a grid cell to set the start point.
2. Click another cell to set the destination.
3. Click the "Find Path" button to visualize the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
4. Reset the grid anytime to test different scenarios.
